        <h1>The Story of the Trojan Horse</h1>
        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>The story of the Trojan Horse is a famous tale from ancient Greece about a long war for the city of Troy. After fighting for ten years without winning, the Greek army came up with a clever trick to finally get inside the city walls and defeat the Trojans.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>The story</h3>
        <p>The main story comes from an old poem called the Aeneid. It says that the Greek leader, Odysseus, had an idea. They built a huge, hollow wooden horse. Some of the best Greek soldiers hid inside. The rest of the Greek army pretended to sail away, leaving the horse behind. The people of Troy saw the big horse and thought the Greeks had given up and left it as a gift to their goddess, Athena. Some people warned them not to bring it inside the city, saying it could be a trap. But the Trojans decided to bring the horse in anyway, thinking they had won the war. That night, while everyone in Troy was asleep and celebrating, the Greek soldiers hidden inside the horse quietly came out. They opened the city gates, and the rest of the Greek army, who had secretly returned, rushed in and destroyed Troy.</p>

        <h3>Was the story real?</h3>
        <p>We don't have any old buildings or objects that prove there was a real wooden horse. Some experts think the story might be a way of talking about a type of war machine the Greeks used, maybe one covered in animal skins. Others think it might just be a great story to show how being clever can be better than just being strong. We do know that there was likely a real war in Troy a long time ago.</p>
        <h3>Why do we still talk about it</h3>
        <p>Even though it's a very old story, the tale of the Trojan Horse is still interesting because it teaches us about how people can trick each other and how important it is to be careful and think things through. It's a great example of how a clever idea can change everything, even in a long and difficult fight.</p>
